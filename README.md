National Key R&D Plan "Intelligent Robot" Special Project: Magnetic Resonance Compatible Surgical Robot for Brain Nerve Intervention
1. Independently developed a surgical interactive assistance system based on Unity 3D, which has been deployed at the United Hospital and has participated in the 7th World Intelligent Congress.
2. Through geometric calculations for surgical path planning, Pyramid Vision Transformer is combined with a CNN network model to perform lesion semantic segmentation and localization on preoperative images of patients, generating a three-dimensional "knowledge-based" virtual surgical knowledge model.
3. Utilize external plugins such as Ultraleaf, OpenHaptics, and MRTK in Unity to develop system functionality with tactile interactive devices, and deploy the project on HoloLens and PC.
4. Realize the registration display of medical models, gesture recognition, and force feedback interaction, achieving the purpose of preoperative exercises and intraoperative guidance.
